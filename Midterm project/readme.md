This is a password manager app based on our cofeeshop example. 

I used AI (Chat GPT) in order to understand how to self create new files in the same directory, inspiration of how PM would look like and navigated me through errors. 

inside those photo files are my ideas on this project. 80% of them weer cvreated in my mind, so I just wrote down the essential part

How this app works:

Once you run this app you will create your master user and password to access the app. 
app will automaticly create a file in the same folder with your master credentials and a "database" that will runn localy on your computer.

once created, you will have 4 options: 1. find password in domain, 2. add password, 3. change password and 4. exit.

select one of them and follow the instructions on the screen 😊
